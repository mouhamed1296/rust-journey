# Documentation of my journey through rust

This project is me roaming on my journey though the world of programming in Rust
and learning the language. I will be documenting my progress and the things I
learn along the way.

I have documented some data structures in rust and how they work. I have also
documented some conditional statements and loops in rust. I have also added a little
project that I have been working on. It is a simple student management system that
manage students and their grades.

I will be adding more as I learn more about the language.
